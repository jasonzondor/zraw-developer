# GitHub Rulesets Setup (Modern Approach)

GitHub Rulesets are the modern replacement for classic branch protection rules. They offer better flexibility and organization.

## Setting Up Rulesets for `main` Branch

### Step 1: Navigate to Rulesets

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **Rules** ‚Üí **Rulesets**
3. Click **New ruleset** ‚Üí **New branch ruleset**

### Step 2: Configure Basic Settings

**Ruleset Name:** `Protect main branch`

**Enforcement status:** `Active`

**Bypass list:** (optional)
- Add yourself if you need emergency access
- Or leave empty for strict enforcement

### Step 3: Target Branches

**Target branches:**
- Click **Add target**
- Select **Include by pattern**
- Pattern: `main`
- Click **Add inclusion pattern**

### Step 4: Configure Rules

Enable the following rules:

#### ‚úÖ **Require a pull request before merging**
- **Required approvals:** `1`
- ‚úÖ Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
- ‚úÖ Require review from Code Owners (optional, if you have CODEOWNERS file)
- ‚úÖ Require approval of the most recent reviewable push
- ‚ùå Require conversation resolution before merging (enable this separately)

#### ‚úÖ **Require status checks to pass**
- ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- **Status checks that are required:**
  - Add: `build` (this comes from your CI workflow)
  - Note: This will appear after your first CI run

#### ‚úÖ **Require conversation resolution before merging**
- Ensures all PR comments are resolved

#### ‚úÖ **Block force pushes**
- Prevents rewriting history on main

#### ‚úÖ **Require linear history** (optional but recommended)
- Enforces a clean, linear git history
- Prevents merge commits (only allows squash or rebase)

#### ‚ùå **Require deployments to succeed** (skip for now)

#### ‚ùå **Require signed commits** (optional, for extra security)
- Enable if you want to require GPG signatures

### Step 5: Additional Settings (at bottom)

**Restrict creations:** ‚ùå (allow creating main branch)
**Restrict updates:** ‚úÖ (this is what protects the branch)
**Restrict deletions:** ‚úÖ (prevent accidental deletion)

**Require code scanning results:** ‚ùå (skip unless you have CodeQL set up)

### Step 6: Save

Click **Create** at the bottom

## Setting Up Rulesets for `develop` Branch (Optional)

If you want to protect `develop` as well:

1. Click **New ruleset** ‚Üí **New branch ruleset**
2. **Ruleset Name:** `Protect develop branch`
3. **Target branches:** `develop`
4. **Rules:** (slightly relaxed)
   - ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass
   - ‚úÖ Block force pushes
   - ‚ùå Require pull request (optional - you can push directly to develop)
   - ‚úÖ Require linear history

## Comparison: Rulesets vs Classic Branch Protection

| Feature | Classic Rules | Rulesets |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Multiple branch patterns | ‚ùå One rule per pattern | ‚úÖ Multiple patterns per ruleset |
| Organization-wide rules | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Better UI/UX | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| More granular controls | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Insights and reporting | Limited | Better |
| Future-proof | Deprecated path | ‚úÖ Active development |

**Recommendation:** Use Rulesets for all new repositories.

## Verifying Your Ruleset

After creating the ruleset:

1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Rules ‚Üí Rulesets**
2. You should see your ruleset listed as **Active**
3. Click on it to view/edit

### Test It:

```bash
# Try to push directly to main (should fail)
git checkout main
echo "test" >> test.txt
git add test.txt
git commit -m "test"
git push origin main
# ‚ùå Should be rejected!

# Correct way: create PR
git checkout -b test-branch
git push origin test-branch
# ‚úÖ Then create PR on GitHub
```

## Ruleset for Tag Protection (Optional)

To protect release tags:

1. Click **New ruleset** ‚Üí **New tag ruleset**
2. **Ruleset Name:** `Protect release tags`
3. **Target tags:** `v*.*.*` (matches v1.0.0, v0.1.0, etc.)
4. **Rules:**
   - ‚úÖ Block force pushes
   - ‚úÖ Restrict deletions
5. **Create**

This prevents accidental deletion or modification of release tags.

---

## Migration from Classic Rules

If you already have classic branch protection rules:

1. Note down your existing rules
2. Create equivalent rulesets (as above)
3. Test the rulesets work correctly
4. Delete the old classic rules:
   - Go to **Settings ‚Üí Branches**
   - Click **Delete** on old rules

**Note:** Rulesets and classic rules can coexist, but it's cleaner to use one system.

## Quick Reference

### Main Branch Ruleset (Strict):
- ‚úÖ Require PR with 1 approval
- ‚úÖ Require status checks (CI must pass)
- ‚úÖ Require conversation resolution
- ‚úÖ Block force pushes
- ‚úÖ Require linear history
- ‚úÖ Restrict deletions

### Develop Branch Ruleset (Relaxed):
- ‚úÖ Require status checks
- ‚úÖ Block force pushes
- ‚ùå PR not required (can push directly)

### Tag Ruleset (Release Protection):
- Pattern: `v*.*.*`
- ‚úÖ Block force pushes
- ‚úÖ Restrict deletions

## Troubleshooting

### "Status check 'build' not found"
- This appears after your first CI run
- Push a commit to trigger CI, then add the status check

### "Cannot push to main"
- This is correct! Create a PR instead
- Or add yourself to bypass list (not recommended)

### "Ruleset not applying"
- Check **Enforcement status** is **Active**
- Verify branch pattern matches (e.g., `main` not `refs/heads/main`)
- Check you're not in the bypass list
