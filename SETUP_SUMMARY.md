# GitHub Repository Setup - Quick Start

## ✅ What's Been Created

Your repository now has professional development workflows:

### 📁 Files Added:
```
.github/
├── workflows/
│   ├── ci.yml              # Continuous Integration
│   └── release.yml         # Automated Releases
├── ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
│   ├── bug_report.md       # Bug report template
│   └── feature_request.md  # Feature request template
└── PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md # PR template

CHANGELOG.md                 # Version history
CONTRIBUTING.md              # Contribution guidelines
GITHUB_SETUP.md             # Detailed setup guide
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Commit These Files (Do This Now!)

```bash
cd /home/jason/Work/personal/zraw-developer

# Add all new files
git add .github/ CHANGELOG.md CONTRIBUTING.md GITHUB_SETUP.md

# Commit
git commit -m "chore: add GitHub workflows and contribution guidelines"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### 2. Enable Branch Protection on GitHub (Using Rulesets)

Go to: **Settings → Rules → Rulesets → New ruleset**

**Create ruleset for `main` branch:**
- Name: `Protect main branch`
- Target: `main`
- ✅ Require pull request (1 approval)
- ✅ Require status checks (`build`)
- ✅ Require conversation resolution
- ✅ Block force pushes
- ✅ Restrict deletions

Click **Create**

**Detailed guide:** See `GITHUB_RULESET_SETUP.md`

### 3. Create Your First Release

```bash
# 1. Tag the current state as v0.1.0
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Initial release with professional color science"

# 2. Push the tag
git push origin v0.1.0

# 3. GitHub Actions will automatically:
#    - Build the release
#    - Create a GitHub Release
#    - Upload binaries

# 4. Check it out!
#    Go to: https://github.com/jasonzondor/zraw-developer/releases
```

## 📋 Daily Workflow (After Setup)

### For Feature Development:

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# 2. Make changes
# ... edit code ...

# 3. Commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"

# 4. Push
git push origin feature/my-feature

# 5. Create PR on GitHub
#    - Go to your repo
#    - Click "Pull requests" → "New pull request"
#    - Select: feature/my-feature → main
#    - Fill out template
#    - Create PR

# 6. After CI passes and approval, merge!
```

### For Quick Fixes (Solo Dev):

If you're working alone and want to move fast:

```bash
# You can still push directly to main for now
git add .
git commit -m "fix: quick bug fix"
git push origin main

# But for releases, always use tags!
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (Do Now):
1. ✅ Commit and push the new files (see above)
2. ✅ Enable branch protection on GitHub
3. ✅ Create your first release (v0.1.0)

### Soon:
1. Create a `develop` branch for ongoing work
2. Update README.md with installation instructions
3. Add screenshots to README
4. Create a LICENSE file (MIT recommended)

### Later:
1. Set up code coverage
2. Add unit tests
3. Create documentation site
4. Add more CI checks (linting, formatting)
